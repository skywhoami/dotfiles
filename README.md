This is where I keep all my config, secrets, and sanity. It's heavily inspired by [isabelroses/dotfiles](https://github.com/isabelroses/dotfiles) _(go follow her, she's a legend)_, but with my own chaotic energy sprinkled on top.

## What's inside?

* **Nix flakes** for my servers and machines (macOS + NixOS)
* **Home Manager** for all my user-level stuff
* **Catppuccin** everywhere because pastel aesthetics > everything
* **Yabai** for tiling my Mac
* **Neovim** set up with LSP, treesitter, and all the plugins I can't live without
* **Secrets** with SOPS and age _(shhh, don't peek)_
* **Justfile** for easy rebuilds and deployments
